# Airdrop SOL

## Step 3: Request an Airdrop

SOL is the native token of the Solana network and is used to pay transaction fees, create on-chain accounts, and deploy programs.
You can think of SOL as API credits required to use the Solana network.

We use the `requestAirdrop` method on the connection to request an airdrop.
This method takes two arguments:

- The public key of the account to receive the airdrop
- The amount of SOL to request in lamports

```ts
requestAirdrop(to: PublicKey, lamports: number): Promise<TransactionSignature>;
```

Lamports are the smallest unit of SOL, where 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports.

Under the hood, a devnet airdrop is simply a transfer of SOL from the faucet to your wallet.
On devnet, you can request an airdrop of 5 SOL per request, but multiple requests may result in rate limiting.

When SOL is transferred to a newly generated keypair, a Solana account owned by the System Program is automatically created using the public key of the keypair.
The System Program is one of Solana's [Native Programs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs).

On Solana, what we refer to as "wallets" are simply accounts owned by the System Program.

## Exercise

Update the editor to request an airdrop of 5 SOL for `wallet_1`.

```ts
const transactionSignature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
  wallet_1.publicKey,
  5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
);
```
