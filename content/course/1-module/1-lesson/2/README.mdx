# Airdrop SOL

In this lesson, we'll walk through how to airdrop devnet SOL to fund a new wallet using the `@solana/web3.js` library.

## Step 1: Establish a Connection

In order to interact with the Solana blockchain, we'll first need to establish a connection to a network.

Solana has 3 different networks:

- **Mainnet-beta**: The live production Solana network
- **Testnet**: A network reserved for validator testing
- **Devnet**: A network that serves as a playground for developers

Alternatively, you can also test locally by running the `solana-test-validator` command from the Solana CLI to start a local validator.

In this course, we'll be using the Devnet in the examples.

## Exercise

Update the editor to establish a connection to Devnet by referencing the code snippet below:

```ts
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"));
```
