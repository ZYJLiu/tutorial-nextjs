# Airdrop SOL

## Try It Yourself

Open a terminal and run the following command to get the starter code:

```terminal
npx solana-starter
```

Once the command runs, open the `solana-starter` folder.
You should see an `index.ts` and `utils.ts` file similiar to the code displayed in the editor to the right.

The `utils` file includes a `getOrCreateKeypair` helper function.
This function will either get an existing keypair from a `.env` file or generate a new one if it doesn't exist.

## Exercise

Run `npm start` in the terminal to execute airdrop script in `index.ts`.

You should see an output similar to the following:

```terminal
wallet_1 address: 7PwT9a44C6tFuMUQr4PV29djxbafbQR9jTY44t1L5zc6
wallet_1 prebalance: 0
wallet_1 postbalance: 5
Transaction Signature: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/8SnR3Uu4qJJHGB79kDHR9Q8p9P1CMvzv6Vr9XBy65X52AAFXjmpfNPZZafYMCpDEh1gpdHP8uVKE8DoTiBhDKf1?cluster=devnet
```

You should also see a `.env` file that contains the newly generated keypair similar to the following:

```env
wallet_1=[63,163,65,23,70,125,101,202,119,231,47,25,152,153,122,233,200,220,174,122,139,94,255,14,147,46,159,170,9,42,208,234,95,6,119,147,222,110,122,5,38,211,142,82,151,108,152,127,22,45,75,54,53,231,76,180,90,37,129,58,46,13,117,7]
```

Note that these are burner keypairs used for demonstration purposes only.
Do not reuse them on mainnet.

In the following sections, we will use this starter code as a base to build on.
