# Airdrop SOL

## Step 5: Get the Balance of the Account

Lastly, we'll fetch the balance of `wallet_1` after the airdrop.

We can get the lamport balance of an account using the `getBalance` method on the connection.
This method takes two argument:

- The public key of the account to fetch the balance for
- An optional commitment level for the request

```ts
getBalance(publicKey: PublicKey, commitmentOrConfig?: Commitment | GetBalanceConfig): Promise<number>;
```

## Exercise

Update the editor to get the balance of `wallet_1` after the airdrop request.
Then log the balance, dividing by `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` to convert to units of SOL.

```ts
const postBalance = await connection.getBalance(wallet_1.publicKey);
console.log("wallet_1 balance:", postBalance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
```
