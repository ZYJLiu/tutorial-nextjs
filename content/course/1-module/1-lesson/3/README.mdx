## Step 2: Generate a Keypair

Next, we need to generate a keypair to represent a wallet.
We can generate keypairs using the `Keypair` class from the `@solana/web3.js` library.

This generates a keypair on the Ed25519 curve, giving us a public key and a secret key.

```js
new Keypair();
```

The public key is 32 bytes and commonly base58 encoded:

```text
PublicKey: FYHeTDzrfRy4jpShuFvC5FH1mo7rApEUzPWC2uZBBdLJ
```

The secret key is 64 bytes, where last 32 bytes are the public key:

```text
Uint8Array(64) [
   35,  36, 204,  65, 255, 246, 180,  26,  99,  79, 192,
  118, 126, 248,  90,  88, 143,  27,  77, 253, 117, 164,
  228,  74, 153, 188,  90,  92, 128, 222,  48,  63, 216,
    7, 113, 132, 215, 178, 202,  62,  98,  29, 214, 216,
   93,  84, 198,   2, 109,  83, 107, 188,  21,  36, 251,
   71, 110, 250, 211,  51,  24, 161,  86,  31
]
```

On Solana, the public key is often used as the address of an on-chain account, while the secret key is used for signing.

However, note that generating a keypair does not automatically create an account on-chain.
We'll cover how to create accounts programmatically in a later lesson.

## Exercise

Update the editor to generate a keypair and store it in a variable called `wallet_1`.

```js
const wallet_1 = new Keypair();
```
