# Introduction

Welcome to the Solana quickstart tutorial! This course will teach you the basics to get started building on Solana.

Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended that you go from start to finish.

## How to use this tutorial

Each lesson include multiple sections that cover a specific topic.
Each section will present an exercise for you to practice as we walk through the content.

The exercises are interactive. You can edit the code in the editor and check your work by clicking the "Check" button.

If you get stuck, you can click the "Hint" button which will show the difference between your code and the solution.

For example, type or paste the following code into the editor and click the "Check" button:

```ts
console.log("Hello, Solana!");
```

Clicking the "Answer" button will update the editor with the solution code.
Before you use this feature, try figuring out where to put each suggested code block into the editor on your own!

When you're ready, click the "Next" button to move on to the next section.
