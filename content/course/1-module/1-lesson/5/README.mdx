# Airdrop SOL

## Step 4: Confirm the Airdrop Transaction

In this step, we'll confirm the airdrop.
This is to ensure that the transaction has been confirmed by the network before we fetch the account balance in the next step.

The `getLatestBlockhash` method is first used to get a recent `blockhash` and `lastValidBlockHeight`.

The `confirmTransaction` method is then used to confirm a transaction.

## Exercise

Update the editor to get the most recent blockhash.

```ts
const { blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight } =
  await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
```

Then confirm the airdrop transaction using the transactionSignature.

```ts
await connection.confirmTransaction(
  {
    blockhash,
    lastValidBlockHeight,
    signature: transactionSignature,
  },
  "confirmed",
);
```
