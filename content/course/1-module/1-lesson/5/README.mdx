# Airdrop SOL

## Step 4: Confirm the Airdrop Transaction

In this step, we'll confirm the airdrop.
This is to ensure that the transaction has been confirmed by the network before we fetch the account balance in the next step.

Solana has 3 different transaction commitment levels:

- **Processed**: The transaction has been processed by the leader and included in a block
- **Confirmed**: The transaction has been included in a block that has been voted on by 66% of the stake weight of the cluster
- **Finalized**: 31 confirmed blocks have been built on top of the block containing the transaction

The `getLatestBlockhash` method is first used to get a recent `blockhash` and `lastValidBlockHeight`.

The `confirmTransaction` method is then used to confirm a transaction.

## Exercise

Update the editor to get the most recent blockhash.

```ts
const { blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight } =
  await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
```

Then confirm the airdrop transaction using the `transactionSignature`, with a commitment level of "confirmed".

```ts
await connection.confirmTransaction(
  {
    blockhash,
    lastValidBlockHeight,
    signature: transactionSignature,
  },
  "confirmed",
);
```
