# Mint Tokens

## Step 2: Create and Send Transaction

Once we have the instruction, we can create a new transaction and send the transaction to the network.

## Exercise

First, create a new `Transaction` and add the instruction to it.

```js
const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
```

Next, sign and send the transaction to the network using `sendAndConfirmTransaction`.

```js
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet_1, // payer
  ],
);
```
