# Create Token Account

## Try It Yourself

If you haven't done so already, open a terminal and get the starter code using the following command:

```terminal
npx solana-starter
```

Once the command runs, open the `solana-starter` folder.

Before proceeding with the exercise, run `npm start` to execute airdrop script in `index.ts`.
You should see a `.env` file with the newly generated keypair funded with devnet SOL.

## Exercise

Copy the code from the editor to the right into your local `index.ts` file.

Then run `npm start` in the terminal to create a new mint account.

You should see an output similar to the following:

```terminal
Transaction Signature: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/65GAhoxBvjiKBN7Yp1ft1YwZTWXnz1Rx5sNy1nKbGiQnfWqyeX2YjRVG4rbd1DDsvRoZULvotrWXat68DHjwQ2Rx?cluster=devnet
Token Account:  https://explorer.solana.com/address/BBpVN6ixcyhKXqxZ2C47KyM9WAfAFUWfNWPwXTJ15cUm?cluster=devnet
```
