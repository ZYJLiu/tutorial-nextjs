# Create Mint

## Step 3: Create and Send Transaction

Once we have both instructions, we can create a new transaction and add both instructions to the transaction.

In this step we are building a single transaction that:

- Invokes the System Program to create a new account with space for a Mint account
- Invokes the Token Program to initialize the data for the new Mint account

We can then sign and send the transaction to the network.

## Exercise

First, create a new `Transaction` and add both `createAccountInstruction` and `initializeMintInstruction` to the transaction.

```js
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  createAccountInstruction,
  initializeMintInstruction,
);
```

Next, sign and send the transaction to the network using `sendAndConfirmTransaction`.

```js
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet_1, // payer
    mint, // mint address keypair
  ],
);
```

Note that we include both `wallet_1` and the `mint` as signers on the transaction.

- `wallet_1` is required as signer because it is the payer for the new mint account
- `mint` is required as signer because we are using it's public key as the address of the new mint account.

When creating accounts using the public key of a newly generately keypair, it is required to include the keypair as a signer on the transaction.
