# Create Mint

## Try It Yourself

If you haven't done so already, open a terminal and get the starter code using the following command:

```terminal
npx solana-starter
```

Once the command runs, open the `solana-starter` folder.

Before proceeding with the exercise, run `npm start` to execute airdrop script in `index.ts`.
You should see a `.env` file with the newly generated keypair funded with devnet SOL.

## Exercise

Copy the code from the editor to the right into your local `index.ts` file.

Then run `npm start` in the terminal to create a new mint account.

You should see an output similar to the following:

```terminal
Transaction Signature: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3YcXv7TYC1pV6bSpa37V5u4KjmJhPpSkv2SdF2D3V589GiBbsQ52uGHgj9dYHpEdZpV6sUZqDu1UfJ9hRcUvfiwi?cluster=devnet
Mint Account: https://explorer.solana.com/address/H1auPh6b5goMdDdHY7cBRy6CHgbMBTbycabYhBaeFwyo?cluster=devnet
```
