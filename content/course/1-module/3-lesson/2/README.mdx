# Create Mint

## Step 1: Create Mint Account

A transaction to create a mint account requires two instructions:

1. Instruction to invoke the System Program to create a new account with the appropriate size and lamports required for a mint account.
2. Instruction to invoke the Token Program to initialize the mint account data

On Solana, the System Progrom is the only program that can create new accounts.
However, the System Program can transfer ownership of new accounts to another program.

In this step we will build the first instruction to create a new account.

We can do this using the `SystemProgram.createAccount` method.
Under the hood, this method creates an instruction to invoke the `createAccount` instruction on the System Program.

```js
static createAccount(params: CreateAccountParams): TransactionInstruction;
```

This method takes in a `CreateAccountParams` object with the following properties:

```js
/**
 * Create account system transaction params
 */
type CreateAccountParams = {
    /** The account that will transfer lamports to the created account */
    fromPubkey: PublicKey;
    /** Public key of the created account */
    newAccountPubkey: PublicKey;
    /** Amount of lamports to transfer to the created account */
    lamports: number;
    /** Amount of space in bytes to allocate to the created account */
    space: number;
    /** Public key of the program to assign as the owner of the created account */
    programId: PublicKey;
};
```

## Exercise

First, calculate the minimum amount of lamports required to store the data for a Mint Account using the `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemptMint` function from `@solana/spl-token`.

```js
const rentLamports = await getMinimumBalanceForRentExemptMint(connection);
```

Next, use the `createAccount` method to build an instruction to create a new account.

```js
const createAccountInstruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
  fromPubkey: wallet_1.publicKey,
  newAccountPubkey: mint.publicKey,
  space: MINT_SIZE,
  lamports: rentLamports,
  programId: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
});
```

The `MINT_SIZE` constant from `@solana/spl-token` specifies the bytes required for the mint account data.

The `programId` specifies that the ownership of the account transfers to the Token Program once the account is created.
This allows the Token Program to initialize the account data in the following instruction.
