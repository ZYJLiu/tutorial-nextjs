# Create Mint

Next, let's go over the basics of the Token Program to better understand how tokens are represented on Solana and to further illustration Solana's account model.

On Solana, the Token Program stores the instructions logic for interacting with all tokens on the network.

All tokens are data accounts owned by the Token Program.

Tokens on Solana are uniquely identified by the address of a “mint account” owned by the Token Program. This account is effectively a global counter for a specific token, and stores data such as:

- Supply: Total supply of the token
- Decimals: Decimal precision of the token
- Mint authority: The account authorized to create new units of the token, and thus increasing the supply
- Freeze authority: The account authorized to freeze tokens from being transferred from "token accounts", which we'll cover in following lessons.

To create a new mint account, we can use the `createMint` helper function from `@solana/spl-token`.

Under the hood, this function builds a transaction, sends it to the network, and returns the address of the newly created mint account.

```js
/**
 * Create and initialize a new mint
 *
 * @param connection      Connection to use
 * @param payer           Payer of the transaction and initialization fees
 * @param mintAuthority   Account or multisig that will control minting
 * @param freezeAuthority Optional account or multisig that can freeze token accounts
 * @param decimals        Location of the decimal place
 * @param keypair         Optional keypair, defaulting to a new random one
 * @param confirmOptions  Options for confirming the transaction
 * @param programId       SPL Token program account
 *
 * @return Address of the new mint
 */
export async function createMint(
    connection: Connection,
    payer: Signer,
    mintAuthority: PublicKey,
    freezeAuthority: PublicKey | null,
    decimals: number,
    keypair = Keypair.generate(),
    confirmOptions?: ConfirmOptions,
    programId = TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
): Promise<PublicKey> {...}
```

## Exercise

Create a new mint account using the `createMint` function.

```js
const mint = await createMint(
  connection,
  wallet_1, // payer
  wallet_1.publicKey, // mint authority
  wallet_1.publicKey, // freeze authority
  2, // decimals
);
```

In the next following sections, we'll manually build the transaction to create a new mint account.
