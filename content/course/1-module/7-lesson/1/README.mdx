# Transfer Tokens

In this lesson we'll learn how to transfer tokens between token accounts.
In order to transfer tokens, both the sender and receiver must have a token account for the token (mint) they are transferring.

To transfer tokens we can use the `transfer` function from the `spl-token` library.

```js
/**
 * Transfer tokens from one account to another
 *
 * @param connection     Connection to use
 * @param payer          Payer of the transaction fees
 * @param source         Source account
 * @param destination    Destination account
 * @param owner          Owner of the source account
 * @param amount         Number of tokens to transfer
 * @param multiSigners   Signing accounts if `owner` is a multisig
 * @param confirmOptions Options for confirming the transaction
 * @param programId      SPL Token program account
 *
 * @return Signature of the confirmed transaction
 */
export async function transfer(
    connection: Connection,
    payer: Signer,
    source: PublicKey,
    destination: PublicKey,
    owner: Signer | PublicKey,
    amount: number | bigint,
    multiSigners: Signer[] = [],
    confirmOptions?: ConfirmOptions,
    programId = TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
): Promise<TransactionSignature> {...}
```

## Exercise

Transfer 1 token from the `sourceTokenAccount` to the `destinationTokenAccount`.
Just like with minting, the amount must be adjusted by the decimals of the mint account.

```js
const transactionSignature = await transfer(
  connection,
  wallet_1, // payer
  sourceTokenAccount.address, // transfer from
  destinationTokenAccount.address, // transfer to
  wallet_1.publicKey, // source token account owner
  100,
);
```
