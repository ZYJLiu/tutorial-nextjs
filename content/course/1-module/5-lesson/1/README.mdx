# Associated Token Account

To simplify the process of locating a token account's address, we often use Associated Token Accounts.
It's important to understand that an Associated Token Account isn't a different kind of token account; it's just a token account with a specific address.

An Associated Token Account is a token account whose address is deterministically derived using a wallet's address and the mint account's address.

When transferring tokens between wallets, the tokens are generally sent to the recipient wallet's Associated Token Account.

For example, if two wallets want to hold units of the same type of token, each wallet needs its own token account for the specific mint account.

This introduces a key concept in Solana development: Program Derived Address (PDA).
Conceptually, a PDA provide a deterministic way to generate an address using some predefined inputs.
This enables us to easily find the address of an account at a later time.

## Associated Token Account Address

The `getAssociatedTokenAddressSync` function from `@solana/spl-token` can be used to derive the address of an Associated Token Account.

```js
// Mint account address
const mint = new PublicKey("...");

// Get associated token account address
const associatedTokenAccountAddress = getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(
  mint, // mint address
  wallet_1.publicKey, // token account owner
);
```

Under the hood, `getAssociatedTokenAddressSync` derives the PDA using `PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync` which returns two values:

- A derived address
- A bump seed

The bump seed is a number between 0 and 255 that is used to ensure the derived address falls off the ed25519 curve.
This means PDAs are addresses without a corresponding private key.

```js
// Manually derive associated token account address
const [PDA, bump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [
    wallet_1.publicKey.toBuffer(), // token account owner
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(), // token program address
    mint.toBuffer(), // mint address
  ],
  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

The `findProgramAddressSync` invokes `createProgramAddressSync` in a loop by changing the bump seed until a valid PDA is found.
The bump starts at 255 and is decremented by 1 until the address derived falls off the ed25519 curve.

```js
const PDA = PublicKey.createProgramAddressSync(
  [
    wallet_1.publicKey.toBuffer(), // token account owner
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID.toBuffer(), // token program address
    mint.toBuffer(),
    Buffer.from([bump]),
  ],
  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
);
```

We can use the `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` helper function from `@solana/spl-token` to either get an existing account or create one if it doesn't exist.

```js
/**
 * Retrieve the associated token account, or create it if it doesn't exist
 *
 * @param connection               Connection to use
 * @param payer                    Payer of the transaction and initialization fees
 * @param mint                     Mint associated with the account to set or verify
 * @param owner                    Owner of the account to set or verify
 * @param allowOwnerOffCurve       Allow the owner account to be a PDA (Program Derived Address)
 * @param commitment               Desired level of commitment for querying the state
 * @param confirmOptions           Options for confirming the transaction
 * @param programId                SPL Token program account
 * @param associatedTokenProgramId SPL Associated Token program account
 *
 * @return Address of the new associated token account
 */
export async function getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection: Connection,
    payer: Signer,
    mint: PublicKey,
    owner: PublicKey,
    allowOwnerOffCurve = false,
    commitment?: Commitment,
    confirmOptions?: ConfirmOptions,
    programId = TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    associatedTokenProgramId = ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
): Promise<Account> {...}
```

## Exercise

Use the `getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount` function to create an Associated Token Account for the `mint` and `wallet_1`.

```js
const associatedTokenAccount = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
  connection,
  wallet_1, // payer
  mint, // mint address
  wallet_1.publicKey, // token account owner
);
```
