# Associated Token Account

## Step 3: Create and Send Transaction

Once we have the instruction, we can create a new transaction and send the transaction to the network.

When using PDAs as the address of new accounts, we do not them as signers on the transaction.
This is because the PDAs do not have a private key and therefore cannot sign transactions.

However, a feature of PDAs is that the program from which a PDA is derived can "sign" transactions on behalf of the PDA.
Since an associated token account address is derived using the Associated Token Program, the Associated Token Program can "sign" to use the PDA as the address of a new account.

Under the hood, the Associated Token Program invokes the System Program to create a new account.
This concept is where one program invokes another program is referred to as a "Cross Program Invocation" (CPI).

## Exercise

First, create a new `Transaction` and add the instruction to it.

```js
const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
```

Next, sign and send the transaction to the network using `sendAndConfirmTransaction`.

```js
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [
    wallet_1, // payer
  ],
);
```
