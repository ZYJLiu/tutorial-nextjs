# Transfer SOL

## Step 2: Create Transaction

Once we have our instruction, we can create a new transaction using the `Transaction` class from `@solana/web3.js`.

```js
const transaction = new Transaction();
```

We can then add instructions to the transaction using the `add` method.

```js
transaction.add(instruction);
```

We can also create a transaction and add multiple instructions at once.

```js
const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction_1, instruction_2);
```

Note that instructions on a transaction are executed in the order they are added to the transaction.

## Exercise

Update the editor to create a transaction with the transfer instruction.

```js
const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);
```
