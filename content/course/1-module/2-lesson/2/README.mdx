# Transfer SOL

## Step 1: Create Instruction

First, we need to create an instruction to transfer SOL from one account to another.

We can do this using the `SystemProgram.transfer` method.
Under the hood, this method creates an instruction to invoke the `transfer` instruction on the System Program.

```ts
static transfer(params: TransferParams | TransferWithSeedParams): TransactionInstruction;
```

This method takes in a `TransferParams` object with the following properties:

```ts
type TransferParams = {
  /** Account that will transfer lamports */
  fromPubkey: PublicKey;
  /** Account that will receive transferred lamports */
  toPubkey: PublicKey;
  /** Amount of lamports to transfer */
  lamports: number | bigint;
};
```

Note that the `fromPubkey` is required as a signer on the transaction since we are deducting the lamport balance from this account.

## Exercise

Update the editor to create a transfer instruction from `wallet_1` to `wallet_2` for the `transferAmount`.

```js
const transferInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: wallet_1.publicKey,
  toPubkey: wallet_2.publicKey,
  lamports: transferAmount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
});
```
