# Transfer SOL

## Step 3: Send Transaction

Once we have our transaction, we'll need to sign and send it to the network.

We'll use the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function, which will sign, send, and confirm a transaction.

```js
export function sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection: Connection, transaction: Transaction, signers: Array<Signer>, options?: ConfirmOptions & Readonly<{
    abortSignal?: AbortSignal;
}>): Promise<TransactionSignature>;
```

The `sendAndConfirmTransaction` function takes the following required parameters:

- `connection`: The connection to the network.
- `transaction`: The transaction to send.
- `signers`: The keypairs to sign the transaction.

## Exercise

Update the editor to send the transaction to the network, including `wallet_1` as a signer.

```js
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [wallet_1],
);
```
