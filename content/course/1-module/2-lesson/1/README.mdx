# Transfer SOL

In this lesson, we'll learn how to build a transaction to transfer SOL from one wallet to another.

Before we get started, let's go over the concepts of transactions and instructions on Solana.

## Transactions Overview

First, let’s expand on the details that make up a transaction:

1. **Message:** At its core, a transaction has a message. This message includes:
   - **Instructions**: An array of instructions to be executed.
   - **Recent Blockhash**: Acts as a timestamp for the transaction.
   - **Feepayer**: Specifies the transaction fee payer.
2. **Signers:** An array of signers included on the transaction.

By default, the first signer on the transaction is set as the fee payer unless otherwise specified.

For simplicity, a transaction can be thought of a request to process one or multiple instructions.

Instructions in a transaction are processed sequentially, in the order they are added to a transaction.
Transactions are processed "atomically", meaning that all instructions either complete successfully or, if one fails, the entire transaction is rejected.

## Instructions Overview

Next, let’s expand on the details that make up an instruction.

Each instruction must specify 3 pieces of information:

- **Program address**: Specifies the program being invoked
- **Accounts**: Lists every account required by the instruction, including other programs
- **Instruction Data**: Specifies the instruction within the program to invoke, plus any additional data required by the instruction

For every account required by an instruction, the following information must be specified:

- **Account address**: The on-chain address of an account.
- **is_signer**: Specify if the account is required as a signer on the transaction.
- **is_writable**: Specify if the account data will be modified.

This information is referred to as the `AccountMeta`.

By clearly identifying the accounts needed for an instruction and specifying whether each account is writable, transaction processing can be parallelized.
This means that if two transactions do not include any accounts which write to the same state, then the transactions can be executed at the same time.

Note that the details for building specific program instructions are often abstracted away by client libraries.
However, it is helpful to understand the underlying structure of transactions and instructions.

In the following sections, we'll learn how to build a transaction to transfer SOL using the `@solana/web3.js` library.
